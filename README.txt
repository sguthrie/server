Copied from GA4GH Reference Implementation
===========================================

This is a copy of the early alpha of the GA4GH reference client
and server applications.

I aim to focus on only the graph branch.

This is under heavy development, and many aspects of
the layout and APIs will change as requirements are better understood.

- For a quick start with the GA4GH API, please see the GA4GH's
  `demo <http://ga4gh-reference-implementation.readthedocs.org/en/stable/demo.html>`_.
- To configure and deploy the GA4GH server in production
  please see the
  `installation
  <http://ga4gh-reference-implementation.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html>`_
  page.
- If you would like to contribute to the project, please see the
  `development
  <http://ga4gh-reference-implementation.readthedocs.org/en/stable/development.html>`_
  page.
